This is a guide on how to write a Knowledge Gap:

"# Creating High-Quality Knowledge Gaps

## Purpose of a Knowledge Gap
A well-defined Knowledge Gap should clearly explain:
- **What do we want?**  
- **What is in our way?**  
- **What could we do to overcome that obstacle?** OR **What is our idea?**  
- **What do we need to know?**  

### Evaluating Learning Activities
Consider the **Learning Activities** summarized in **"What We Will Do"**:
- Are these **Learning Activities** appropriate for this type of **Knowledge Gap**?
- How will we know when we are **done**?
- Is there a **faster or easier** way to find out what we need to know?

---

## Review Questions for Knowledge Gap Reports

### Assessing the "Question to Answer"
- **Relevant**: Will the answer help us make a better **Key Decision**?
- **Answerable**: Can we get an answer in a **realistic amount of time**?
- **Unbiased**: Does it avoid **pre-supposing** an answer or implying a solution?
- **Focused**: Will we be able to tell **when** we have answered the question?

---

## Stages of Reviewing a Knowledge Gap

### **Before Executing the Learning Plan**
- Reviewing your **Knowledge Gap Report** with teammates at multiple points during the **Learning Cycle** can be helpful.

### **Before Planning the Investigation**
At the **end of each row** in your **PDCA sheet**, ask:
- What actually happened?
- What did you learn?
- Based on that, what is your next experiment?
- How soon can we see what we have learned from that experiment?

### **While Doing PDCA Steps**
- Continuously track **insights** and **next steps**.

---

## Evaluating "What We Have Learned"
- Clearly state the **key learnings**.
- Explain how the **learnings** are relevant to the **Key Decision**.
- Use **visual models** rather than text when possible.

---

## Chart Checklist (For Charts and Graphs)
- [ ] **Title** is clear and informative.
- [ ] **Both axes** are labeled.
- [ ] **Units** are shown.
- [ ] If **multiple colors** are used, each has a clear meaning.
- [ ] **Colors** are easily distinguishable.
- [ ] **Font** is easy to read (large enough, sans serif).
- [ ] **Chart has a key** or legend if needed.
- [ ] No **extraneous graphics** are shown.
- [ ] **Interesting points** are labeled or indicated.

---

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- Have you stated whether this **Knowledge Gap** should be:
  - **Closed now**  
  - **Continued in the next Learning Cycle**  
  - **Shelved**  
- Is there anything else the team should do **next**?

---

## Evaluating "What We Have Done"
- Does it give a **rough idea** of what the team did?
- Does it inspire **confidence** that nothing important was missed?
- Does it provide **links or references** for further details?

---

## Final Updates and Integration
- Is the **final disposition** of the **Knowledge Gap** correctly stated? (**Closed, continued, or shelved**).
- **Note**: If the **Key Learnings** are later invalidated, this **Knowledge Gap Report** should be updated accordingly.

---

### **Review Summary**
- Have we followed all the **critical review questions**?
- Does our **Knowledge Gap Report** effectively guide **future learning cycles**?
- Is the report **structured**, **concise**, and **actionable**?

This is a guide on how to write a Key Decision:
"
# Agentic Guide: Reviewing Key Decision Reports

## Purpose of a Key Decision Report
A well-defined **Key Decision Report** should clearly explain:
- **What do we want?**  
- **What are we deciding and when do we need to know?**  
- **What makes this decision high impact?**  
- **What makes this decision high unknown?**  

---

## Evaluating the Key Decision Question
- **Significant**: The consequences of a wrong decision are serious.  
- **Actionable**: The decision clearly drives subsequent actions.  
- **Unbiased**: Does not pre-suppose an answer or imply a decision.  
- **Focused**: We can tell **what** will be affected by the decision.  

---

## Suggested Review Questions

### **After the Kickoff Meeting**
Before starting Knowledge Gaps, review:
- **Is the Key Decision clearly articulated?**  
- **Are any Knowledge Gaps missing?**  

To ensure **effective decision-making**, check if closing all Knowledge Gaps will result in:
- A **list of options**.  
- **Clear criteria** for evaluating those options.  
- **Criteria that consider the primary risks** of the Key Decision.  
- The **right data** to evaluate each option against the criteria.  

---

## Reviewing the Learning Cycle Plan
Does the Learning Plan account for:
- **Knowledge Gaps** that must be closed in a particular order?  
- **Resource constraints**? (e.g., will working on all Knowledge Gaps at the same time create conflicts?)  

---

## **During Investigation**
Regularly monitor **progress** and **relevance**:
- **Do we still need all the Knowledge Gaps?**  
- **Is each Knowledge Gap delivering the necessary knowledge?**  
- **Do Knowledge Gap Owners need help with any obstacles?**  
- **Are we discovering enough knowledge to support a confident decision?**  

---

## **When Investigation is Complete**
### **Review "What We Have Learned" Sections**
- Do I understand the **key learnings**?  
- Is there a **clear recommendation** for the Key Decision?  
- Is the **rationale for that recommendation clear and complete**?  

### **Review "What We Have Done" Section**
- Does it give a **clear overview** of what was done (and not done)?  
- Does it inspire **confidence** that nothing important was missed?  
- Does it provide **links or references** to Knowledge Gap Reports?  

---

## **Analyzing the Decision**
### **Review "What We Have Learned" & Analysis Sections**
- Are the **learnings clearly stated**?  
- Are the **pros and cons of the options** clear? (Hint: try a **visual model**)  
- If using a **decision table**, avoid **adding up scores** (unless all criteria are measured in the same way).  
- Is the **rationale for the final conclusion clearly stated**?  

### **Review "What We Have Decided" Section**
- Is the **final decision clearly stated**?  
- Does the **Learning Plan need updates**?  
- **Note**: If the **Key Decision is later revisited**, update the Key Decision Report accordingly.  

---

## **After the Decision is Made**
- **Is the Key Decision Report clear and convincing?**  
- **Update the report** with **actual results**.  

---

## **While Developing the Key Decision Report**
### **Recommendations and Next Steps**
- Is the **recommendation clearly stated**?  
- Does the **recommendation logically follow** from the conclusion?  
- Have **remaining risks or unknowns** been summarized?  
- Is there **anything else** the team should do next?  

### **Review Conclusion and Recommendation**
- Are they in **alignment**?  

---

## **Before Presenting the Key Decision Report**
- Review final **Knowledge Gap Reports**:  
  **Do I have everything I need?**  

---

### **Final Review Summary**
- **Does the Key Decision Report support confident action?**  
- **Are all necessary factors considered and documented?**  
- **Is the report structured, concise, and actionable?**
